\Question{Modular Practice}

\notelinks{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n6.pdf}{Note 6}}
Solve the following modular arithmetic equations for $x$ and $y$.
\begin{Parts}
\Part $9x+5 \equiv 7 \pmod{13}$.

\Part Show that $3x+12 \equiv 4 \pmod{21}$ does not have a solution.

\Part The system of simultaneous equations
$5x+4y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ and $2x+y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$.

\Part $13^{2023} \equiv x \pmod{12}$.

\Part $7^{62} \equiv x \pmod{11}$.

\end{Parts}

\Question{Nontrivial Modular Solutions}

\notelinks*{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n6.pdf}{Note 6}}
\begin{Parts}
    \Part What are all the possible perfect cubes modulo 7? In other words, compute the set
    \[
        \{x^3 \bmod{7} \mid x \in \mathbb{Z}\}
    .\]

    \Part Show that any solution to $x^3 + 2y^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ must satisfy $x \equiv y \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.

    \Part Using part (b), prove that $x^3 + 2y^3 = 7x^2 y$ has no non-trivial solutions $(x, y)$ in the integers. In other words, there are no integers $x$ and $y$, that satisfy this equation, except the trivial solution $x=y=0$.

    [\emph{Hint:} Consider some nontrivial solution $(x, y)$ with the smallest value for $\abs{x}$ (why are we allowed to consider this?). Then arrive at a contradiction by finding another solution $(x', y')$ with $\abs{x'} < \abs{x}$.]

\end{Parts}

\Question{Squares}

Let $p$ be a prime greater than 2. We will prove that there exists an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ if and only if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

\begin{Parts}
	\Part Show that if $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, there is no integer $a$ such that $a^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$. (Hint: Use Fermat's Little Theorem.)

    \Part Wilson's Theorem states the following is true if and only if $p$ is prime:
    \[(p - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.\]
    Prove both directions (it holds if \emph{and} only if $p$ is prime).

    Hint for the if direction: Consider rearranging the terms in $(p - 1)! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot (p - 1)$ to pair up terms with their inverses, when possible. What terms are left unpaired?

    Hint for the only if direction: If $p$ is composite, then it has some prime factor $q$.  What can we say about $(p-1)! \pmod{q}$?

    \Part Show that if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, there is an integer $a$ such that $a^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$. (Hint: Consider $a = \left(\frac{p - 1}{2}\right)!$, then use Wilson's Theorem.)

\Question{Celebrate and Remember Textiles}
\notelinks{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n6.pdf}{Note 6}}
Mathematics and computing both owe an immense debt to textiles, where many key ideas originated.

Instructions for knitting patterns will tell you to begin by ``casting
on'' the needle some multiple of $m$ plus $r$, where $m$ is the number
of stitches to create one repetition of the pattern and $r$ is the
number of stitches needed for the two edges of the piece. For example,
in the simple rib stitch pattern below, the repeating pattern is of
length $m=4$, and you need $r=2$ stitches for the edges.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex]
        \def\scale{0.8}
        \foreach[count=\x from 0] \val in {+,\times,\times,\bigcirc,\bigcirc,+} {
            \draw[thick] ({\scale*\x}, 0) rectangle ({\scale*\x+\scale}, \scale);
            \node[thick] at ({\scale*\x+0.5*\scale}, {0.5*\scale}) {$\val$};
        }
        \draw[Bar-Bar] (\scale, -0.25) -- (5*\scale, -0.25) node[below, pos=0.5] {\small Pattern of length 4};
        \node (edge-1) at (0.5*\scale, 2*\scale) {\small Edge stitch};
        \draw (edge-1) edge[->] (0.5*\scale, \scale);
        \node (edge-2) at (5.5*\scale, 2*\scale) {\small Edge stitch};
        \draw (edge-2) edge[->] (5.5*\scale, \scale);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Thus, to make the final piece wider, you can add as many multiples of the pattern of length 4 as you like;
for example, if you want to repeat the pattern 3 times, you need to cast on a total of $3m+ r = 3(4) + 2 = 14$ stitches (shown below).
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex]
        \def\scale{0.8}
        \foreach[count=\x from 0] \val in {+,\times,\times,\bigcirc,\bigcirc,\times,\times,\bigcirc,\bigcirc,\times,\times,\bigcirc,\bigcirc,+} {
            \draw[thick] ({\scale*\x}, 0) rectangle ({\scale*\x+\scale}, \scale);
            \node[thick] at ({\scale*\x+0.5*\scale}, {0.5*\scale}) {$\val$};
        }
        \draw[Bar-Bar] (\scale, -0.25) -- (5*\scale, -0.25);
        \draw[Bar-Bar] (5*\scale, -0.25) -- (9*\scale, -0.25) node[below, pos=0.5] {\small Patterns of length 4};
        \draw[Bar-Bar] (9*\scale, -0.25) -- (13*\scale, -0.25);

        \node (edge-1) at (0.5*\scale, 2*\scale) {\small Edge stitch};
        \draw (edge-1) edge[->] (0.5*\scale, \scale);
        \node (edge-2) at (13.5*\scale, 2*\scale) {\small Edge stitch};
        \draw (edge-2) edge[->] (13.5*\scale, \scale);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
You've decided to knit a 70-themed baby blanket as a gift for your cousin and
want to incorporate rows from three different stitch patterns with the
following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alternating Link: Multiple of 7, plus 4
\item Double Broken Rib: Multiple of 4, plus 2
\item Swag: Multiple of 5, plus 2
\end{itemize}

You want to be able to switch between knitting these different
patterns without changing the number of stitches on the needle, so you
must use a number of stitches that simultaneously meets the requirements of all three
patterns.

Find the \emph{smallest number of stitches} you need to cast on in
order to incorporate all three patterns in your baby blanket.

\Question{Euler's Totient Theorem}

\notelinks{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n6.pdf}{Note 6},\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n7.pdf}{Note 7}}
Euler's Totient Theorem states that, if $n$ and $a$ are coprime,
\[
  a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
\]
where $\phi(n)$ (known as Euler's Totient Function) is the number of positive
integers less than or equal to $n$ which are coprime to $n$ (including 1).

\begin{Parts}
  \Part Let the numbers less than $n$ which are coprime to $n$ be $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}$. 
  Argue that the set
  \[\{am_1, am_2, \ldots, am_{\phi(n)}\}\]
  is a permutation of the set
  \[\{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\}.\]
  In other words, prove that 
  \[f:\{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\} \to \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_{\phi(n)}\}\]
  is a bijection, where $f(x) \coloneqq ax \pmod{n}$.

  \Part Prove Euler's Theorem. (Hint: Recall the FLT proof.)
\end{Parts}

\Question{Sparsity of Primes}

\notelinks{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n6.pdf}{Note 6}}
A prime power is a number that can be written as $p^i$ for some prime $p$ and some
positive integer $i$. So, $9 = 3^2$ is a prime power, and so is $8 = 2^3$. $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$ is not
a prime power.

Prove that for any positive integer $k$, there exists $k$ consecutive positive integers
such that none of them are prime powers.

\emph{Hint: This is a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. We want to find $n$ such that $(n + 1)$, $(n + 2)$, \ldots, and $(n + k)$ are all not powers of primes. We can enforce this by saying that $n + 1$ through $n + k$ each must have two distinct prime divisors.}
