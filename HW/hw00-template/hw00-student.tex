\begin{solution}
    https://www.eecs70.org/
\end{solution}

        \item What percentage score is needed to earn full credit on a homework?
        \\\begin{solution}
            73\%
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

\end{Parts}



\Question{Course Policies}

Go to the course website and read the course policies carefully. Leave a followup on Ed if you have any questions. Are the following situations violations of course policy? Write "Yes" or "No", and a short explanation for each.

\begin{Parts}
  \Part Alice and Bob work on a problem in a study group. They write up a solution together and submit it, noting on their submissions that they wrote up their homework answers together. 
  \begin{solution}
    No
\end{solution}
  
  \Part Carol goes to a homework party and listens to Dan describe his approach to a problem on the board, taking notes in the process. She writes up her homework submission from her notes, crediting Dan.
  \begin{solution}
    No
\end{solution}
  
  \Part Erin comes across a proof that is part of a homework problem while studying course material. She reads it and then, after she has understood it, writes her own solution using the same approach. She submits the homework with a citation to the website.
  \begin{solution}
    Yes
\end{solution}
  
  \Part Frank is having trouble with his homework and asks Grace for help. Grace lets Frank look at her written solution. Frank copies it onto his notebook and uses the copy to write and submit his homework, crediting Grace.
  \begin{solution}
    No
\end{solution}
  
  \Part Heidi has completed her homework using \LaTeX. Her friend Irene has been working on a homework problem for hours, and asks Heidi for help. Heidi sends Irene her PDF solution, and Irene uses it to write her own solution with a citation to Heidi.
  \begin{solution}
    No
\end{solution}
  
  \Part
  Joe found homework solutions before they were officially released, and every time he got stuck, he looked at the solutions for a hint. He then cited the solutions as part of his submission.
  \begin{solution}
    No
\end{solution}
\end{Parts}

\Question{Use of Ed}

Ed is incredibly useful for Q\&A in such a large-scale class. We will use Ed for all important announcements. You should check it frequently. We also highly encourage you to use Ed to ask questions and answer questions from your fellow students.

\begin{Parts}
  
    \Part Read the Ed Etiquette section of the course policies and explain what is wrong with the following hypothetical student question: "Can someone explain the proof of Theorem XYZ to me?" (Assume Theorem XYZ is a complicated concept.)
    \begin{solution}
        Ed is not OH. 5 minute-test
    \end{solution}
    \Part When are the weekly posts released? Are they required reading?
    \begin{solution}
        Mondays and YES
    \end{solution}
    \Part If you have a question or concern not directly related to the course content, where should you direct it?
    \begin{solution}
        Ed
    \end{solution}
\end{Parts}

\Question{Academic Integrity}

Please write or type out the following pledge in print, and sign it.

\begin{quote}
I pledge to uphold the university's honor code: to act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others, including their work. By signing, I ensure that all written homework I submit will be in my own words, that I will acknowledge any collaboration or help received, and that I will neither give nor receive help on any examinations. 
\end{quote}
\begin{solution}
    Richard Lee
\end{solution}
\Question{Propositional Practice}

\notelinks{\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n1.pdf}{Note 1}}
In parts (a)-(c), convert the English sentences into propositional logic. In parts (d)-(f), convert the propositions into English. In part (f), let $P(a)$ represent the proposition that $a$ is prime.
\begin{Parts}

\Part There is one and only one real solution to the equation $x^2 = 0$.
\\\begin{solution}
    $(\exists x \in \mathbb{R})\ ((x^2 = 0) \land (\forall y \in \mathbb{R})\ (y^2 = 0) \implies (x = y))$
\end{solution}
\Part Between any two distinct rational numbers, there is another rational number.
\\\begin{solution}
    $(\forall x,y \in \mathbb{Q})\ (x \not= y) \implies (\exists z \in \mathbb{Q})\ (x < z < y)$
\end{solution}
\Part If the square of an integer is greater than 4, that integer is greater than 2 or it is less than -2.
\\\begin{solution}
    $(\forall x \in \mathbb{Z})\ (x^2 > 4) \implies (x > 2 \lor x < -2)$
\end{solution}
\Part $(\forall x \in \mathbb{R})\ (x \in \mathbb{C})$
\\\begin{solution}
    Every real number is a complex number.
\end{solution}
\Part $(\forall x,y \in \mathbb{Z}) (x^2-y^2 \not=10)$
\\\begin{solution}
    The difference of the squares of any two integers is not 10.
\end{solution}
\Part $(\forall x \in \mathbb{N})\ \left[ \ (x > 1) \implies \ (\exists a, b \in \mathbb{N})  \ \left( (a + b = 2x)\land P(a) \land P(b) \right) \ \right]$
\\\begin{solution}
    Every natural number greater than 1 is the average of two primes.
\end{solution}
